1) The "Vaman board" refers to the Vaman single-board computer (SBC) used for a variety of applications.

2) The VAMAN board is a training and development board often used in embedded systems education and research. 
It typically integrates ARM processors, FPGA, and various GPI/O interfaces, allowing students and engineers to learn and prototype real-time embedded applications.

3) The Vaaman board, particularly with its integrated FPGA, can be used for hardware acceleration in various applications and autonomous navigation systems in drones and robots.

4) FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array): An FPGA is a integrated circuit that can be programmed to implement custom digital logic. 
Unlike a microcontroller (which runs sequential code), an FPGA is programmed using hardware description languages (HDL) like Verilog to build custom digital circuits.

5) ARM processors are widely used in embedded systems, including mobile phones leading to low power consumption and high performance.

6) Right side of vaman board represents ESP32 and left side M4-FPGA (Pygmy).

7) The VamanLC Board uses tools that can run on your Android Phone without needing a Laptop/PC.
